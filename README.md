# Guess the next card
A simple drinking game built in desparate times.

# How to run/play
- Get the code on your local computer (Git clone baby)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (I dont need to be more specific, do I)
- `python index.py`
- Make a guess (Add your own rules, make it fun)
- Press return (Enter) key to unfold the next card.
- Take a sip if you got your guess wrong (or empty the whole bottle, who's watching)
- Needless to say, repeat the last three steps until someone pukes the shit out of themselves.
